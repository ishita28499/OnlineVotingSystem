						<p class="story1">An election is a formal group
							decision-making process by which a population chooses an
							individual to hold public office. It is usually used in
							Democratic nations.</p>
						<p class="story2">Elections have been the usual mechanism by
							which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th
							century.[1] Elections may fill offices in the legislature,
							sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and
							local government. This process is also used in many other private
							and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations
							and corporations.</p>

						<p class="story1">The universal use of elections as a tool for
							selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is
							in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype,
							ancient Athens, where the Elections were not used were considered
							an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled
							using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders
							were chosen by lot.</p>

						<p class="story1">Electoral reform describes the process of
							introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place,
							or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems.
							Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating
							to elections (especially with a view to predicting future
							results).</p>

						<p class="story1">To elect means "to select or make a
							decision", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as
							referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the
							United States.</p>

						<p class="story1">In Vedic period of India, the Raja (chiefs)
							of a gana (a tribal organization) was apparently elected by the
							gana. The Raja belonged to the noble Kshatriya varna (warrior
							class), and was typically a son of the previous Raja. However,
							the gana members had the final say in his elections. Even during
							the Sangam Period people elected their representatives by casting
							their votes and the ballot boxes (Usually a pot) were tied by
							rope and sealed. After the election the votes were taken out and
							counted. The Pala King Gopala (ruled c. 750sâ€“770s CE) in early
							medieval Bengal was elected by a group of feudal chieftains. Such
							elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the
							region. In the Chola Empire, around 920 CE, in Uthiramerur (in
							present-day Tamil Nadu), palm leaves were used for selecting the
							village committee members. The leaves, with candidate names
							written on them, were put inside a mud pot. To select the
							committee members, a young boy was asked to take out as many
							leaves as the number of positions available. This was known as
							the Kudavolai system.</p>

						<p class="story1">The modern "election", which consists of
							public elections of government officials, didn't emerge until the
							beginning of the 17th century when the idea of representative
							government took hold in North America and Europe.</p>


						<p class="story1">Questions of suffrage, especially suffrage
							for minority groups, have dominated the history of elections.
							Males, the dominant cultural group in North America and Europe,
							often dominated the electorate and continue to do so in many
							countries. Early elections in countries such as the United
							Kingdom and the United States were dominated by landed or ruling
							class males. However, by 1920 all Western European and North
							American democracies had universal adult male suffrage (except
							Switzerland) and many countries began to consider women's
							suffrage. Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult
							males, political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair
							access to elections</p>
